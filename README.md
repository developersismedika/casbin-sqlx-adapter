# casbin-sqlx-adapter
sqlx adapter for Casbin https://github.com/casbin/casbin

Based on [sqlx](https://github.com/jmoiron/sqlx), and tested in [MySQL](https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql).

## Installation

    go get github.com/developersismedika/casbin-sqlx-adapter

## NOTICE

The v2 version of Casbin has some break change, check for the [detail](https://github.com/casbin/casbin/releases/tag/v2.0.0). If you are still using v1 version, use `0.1.x` of this project. And if you have been using the package before, and wanting to upgrade, check the following massage.

The adapter maintained by Casbin team introduce a **BREAKING CHANGE** by changing the column name from **p_type** to **ptype**, see the issue in [gorm-adapter](https://github.com/casbin/gorm-adapter/issues/156) and [xorm-adapter](https://github.com/casbin/xorm-adapter/issues/53). Thought I think the adapter layer is able to imply its own storage detail, I follow this **BREAKING CHANGE** in version `0.3.0` in case of developers may port to different adapters.

The implement is kind of different from the [official one](https://casbin.org/docs/adapters). In this implement you should create the database and table on your own.

In my opinion, in a general PRODUCTION environment, the business code is only allow to do DML but not DDL.

The filtered adapter feature has been added in some adapter implements such as [Xorm Adapter](https://github.com/casbin/xorm-adapter). However, it's not yet documented in the [doc](https://casbin.org/docs/en/adapters). I will add it after it's documented. See this [issue](https://github.com/casbin/casbin/issues/707).

## Usage example

```go
opts := &AdapterOptions{
    DriverName: "mysql",
    DataSourceName: "root:1234@tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/yourdb",
    TableName: "casbin_rule",
    // or reuse an existing connection:
    // DB: myDBConn,
}

a := NewAdapterFromOptions(opts)
// Casbin v2 may return an error
e, err := casbin.NewEnforcer("examples/rbac_model.conf", a)
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
```

## Thank

Special thanks to [Casbin](https://github.com/casbin). They provide a superb authorization library.

Special thanks to [sqlx](https://github.com/jmoiron/sqlx). It provides a brilliant set of extensions on go's standard `database/sql` library.

And this project is inspected by [Xorm Adapter](https://github.com/casbin/xorm-adapter), [Gorm Adapter](https://github.com/casbin/gorm-adapter), [Beego ORM Adapter](https://github.com/casbin/beego-orm-adapter) and [MySQL adapter
](https://github.com/casbin/mysql-adapter). Thanks all of them.
